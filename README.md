## Abstract- every year all over the world many people suffer brain stroke and this disease has become the second most devastating disease in case of deaths. In India     after every 20-30 seconds a brain stroke case is registered and these numbers are horrifying. Covid-19 has also contributed to the number of stroke patients, as         studies have shown that after Covid effects may lead to stroke if not taken care of at early stages. Machine learning in early stroke detection has shown many positive   results which can be very helpful for a healthy lifestyle. Many models have. Many models are based on data manipulation and machine learning algorithms. In this model,   we have worked upon a huge data set of different parameters which are somewhere responsible for brain stroke. The data set consists of Age, gender, hypertension, work   type, resident type, Smoking, Heart disease, ever married. We have used machine learning algorithms like the random forest, decision tree, KNN, Logistic Regression on   the refined data set and predicted the accuracies respectively. The accuracies of each algorithm were varying with decimal places but Logistic Regression had 94.52%of   accuracy and performed best on the data set.
